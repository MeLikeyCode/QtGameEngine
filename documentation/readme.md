How to generate documentation
=============================
1. launch a shell (powershell, command prompt, bash, etc)
2. cd into the 'QtGameEngine/documentation' directory
3. run 'doxygen Doxyfile'

The generated docuementation is placed inside the 'QtGameEngine/doxygen output' folder.

Note: Obviously, you need to have doxygen installed and it should be found in your PATH environment variable.
