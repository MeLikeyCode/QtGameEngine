How to generate documentation
=============================
1. launch a shell (powershell, command prompt, bash, etc)
2. cd into the `QtGameEngine/documentation` directory
3. run `doxygen DoxyfileFull` or `doxygen DoxyfileFast`. `doxygen DoxyfileFull` will include more diagrams in the documentation but take longer. 

The generated docuementation is placed inside the 'QtGameEngine/doxygenOutput' folder.

Note: Obviously, you need to have doxygen installed and it should be found in your PATH environment variable.
