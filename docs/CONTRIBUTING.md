Contribution guidelines
=======================

Hello! I'm flattered that you're considering contributing to the game engine!

Core developers
---------------
I would like the engine to be *directed* by a few *core developers*. You can become a core developer by interviewing with me after you have made one (or a few) high quality contributions and demonstrated a solid interest in the engine. The core developers are responsible for approving/denying pull requests and controling the general direction of the game engine/its community. 

Contributing
------------
If you would like to become a contributer, I suggest you start by learning how to *use* the engine. Then head on over to the documentation and read the developer docs. Play/modify the example projects. Once you have a solid feel for how the engine is organized, its conventions, etc, extend it in some way and send a pull request.

Version control pattern
-----------------------
We will be following the **github-flow** version control pattern, which means that master is **always** deployable. Branch off master, make your changes, test them, and when you are ready, open a pull request to master.

I look forward to working with you all!
