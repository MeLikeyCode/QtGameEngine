Contribution guidelines
=======================

Hello! I'm flattered that you've decided to contribute to the game engine!

TODO
- explain how there will be a small team of core developers
    - people get on this exclusive list by a) interviewing with me or b) making frequent and/or high quality contributions
- tell them to first familiarize themselves with how to *use* the game engine (look over/reproduce example projects at least)
- tell them to read the "developers" section of documentation
- tell them to pay attention to conventions!
