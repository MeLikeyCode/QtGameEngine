@page qgeDeveloperDocs QGE Developer Docs

The pages in this section are for those interested in extending/modifying the QtGameEngine source itself (rather than just using the engine in their project).

It covers things such as:
- how the files/folders of the project are organized (so you know where to find things)
- coding conventions we use
- how-to articles

@note You should take a look at the diagrams in the `QtGameEngine/documentation/diagrams` folder. They can give you a nice high level ("archetectural view") of the game engine.
