Welcome to the QGE documentation! {#mainpage}
==================================================

I recommend you start by watching my [YouTube tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMgDVIa0Pg8Wglcri_5zQjhoOVONbSVAJ) on how to use the engine.

Then check out the example projects in the `QtGameEngine/examples` directory. Run the examples, play with them, change them, improve them. As you are messing with the examples, read the documentation for the classes that you use (you can use the `Classes` link on the left sidebar or use the Search on the top right of the page) . That should get you nice and warmed up. 

Next, you might want to consider looking at the diagrams in the `QtGameEngine/docs/diagrams` folder. They should give you a nice big picture of the game engine.

If you decide to contribute to the QGE code base itself, the "QGE Developer Docs" section of this documentation is for you. Prior to contributing, please read the contribution guidelines and code of conduct.
