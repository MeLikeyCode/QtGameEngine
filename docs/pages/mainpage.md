Welcome to the documentation! {#mainpage}
==================================================

Note for the future: This page will basically "tie" the entire documentation together. It will have links to pages that document specific sub systems (e.g. projectile system, ability system, etc) as well as links to the visio diagrams. Furthermore, it will have links to additional resources, such as tutorials, video tutorials, examples, etc. This is what I meant by this page "tieing" the entire documentation together. It should be the main portal which will guide users to more specific resources.
